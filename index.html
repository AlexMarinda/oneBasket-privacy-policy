•    We verify the identities of Customers, or of Delivery/Service recipients who request alcohol delivery, including by collecting photographs of their government-issued identification.
•    Demographic data: We may collect demographic data about users, including through user surveys. In some countries, we may also receive demographic data about users from third parties.
We may also infer demographic data from other data collected from users. For example, where necessary to enable features that allow women to provide or receive services from other women, we may infer gender using their first name. In such cases, we enable users to change their gender if necessary via in-app settings.
•    User Content: We collect the data submitted by users when they contact our customer support (including via videoconferencing tools), provide ratings or compliments for other users, vendors or merchants, or otherwise contact Us.

1. Data created during the use of our services. This includes: 
•    Location data (driver, service provider, and delivery person): We collect Drivers/Service Providers’ and Delivery/Service persons’ precise or approximate location data, including to enable services and deliveries, to enable services/delivery tracking and safety features, to prevent and detect fraud, and to satisfy legal requirements. The app collects this data when our app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) or background (app open but not on-screen) of their mobile device.
•    Location data (Customers and Delivery/Service recipients). We collect Customers’ and Delivery/Service recipients’ precise or approximate location data to enable and enhance the use of our apps, including improving pick-ups, facilitating deliveries, enabling safety features, and preventing and detecting fraud. 
We collect such data from users’ mobile devices if they enable us to do so. (See “Choice and transparency” below for information on how Customers and Delivery/Service recipients can enable location data collection). Our apps collect such data from the time a service or delivery is requested until it is finished (and may indicate such collection via an icon or notification on your mobile device depending on your device’s operating system), and any time the app is running in the foreground (app open and on-screen) of their mobile device.
Customers and Delivery/Service recipients may use the apps without enabling them to collect precise location data from their mobile devices. However, this may affect features in the apps. For example, a user who has not enabled location data collection will have to manually enter their pick-up address. In addition, the location data collected from a driver during a trip will be linked to the rider’s account, even if the rider has not enabled location data to be collected from their device, including for purposes of receipt generation, customer support, fraud detection, insurance, and litigation.
•    Transaction information: We collect transaction information related to the use of our services, including the type of services requested or provided, order details, payment transaction information (such as a vendor’s or merchant's name and location and amount of transaction), delivery information, date and time the service was provided, amount charged, distance traveled, and payment method. Additionally, if someone uses your promotion code, we may associate your name with that person.
•    Usage data: We collect data about how users interact with our services. This includes data such as access dates and times, app features or pages viewed, app crashes and other system activity, and type of browser. We may also collect data regarding the third-party sites or services used before interacting with our services, which we use for marketing. (Please see "How We Use Data" below for more information on how we market our services to users).
In some cases, we collect this data through cookies, pixels, tags, and similar tracking technologies that create and maintain unique identifiers. 
•    Device data: We may collect data about the devices used to access our services, including the hardware models, device IP address or other unique device identifiers, operating systems and versions, software, preferred languages, advertising identifiers, device motion data, and mobile network data.
•    Communications data: We enable users to communicate with each other through our mobile apps and websites. For example, we enable Drivers/Service Providers and Customers, and Delivery/Service persons and Delivery/Service recipients, to call, text, or send other files to each other (generally without disclosing their telephone numbers to each other). To provide this service, We receive some data regarding the calls, texts, or other communications, including the date and time of the communications and the content of the communications. We may also use this data for customer support services (including to resolve disputes between users), for safety and security purposes, to improve our services and features, and for analytics.
2. Data from other sources. These include:
•    Users participating in our referral programs. For example, when a user refers to another person, we receive the referred person’s data from that user.
•    users or others providing information in connection with claims or disputes.
•   Our business partners through which users create or access their accounts, such as payment providers, social media services, or apps or websites that use Our APIs.
•    Our business partners in connection with debit or credit cards issued by a financial institution in partnership with Us to the extent disclosed in the terms and conditions for the card.
•    vendors who help us verify users’ identity, background information, and eligibility to work, or who screen users in connection with sanctions, anti-money laundering, or know-your-customer requirements 
•    publicly available sources
•    marketing service providers or data resellers whose data is used for marketing or research
•    law enforcement officials, public health officials, and other government authorities
We may combine the data collected from these sources with other data in our possession.

We use personal data to enable reliable and convenient transportation, delivery, and other products and services. We also use such data:
•    to enhance the safety and security of our users and services
•    for customer support  
•    for research and development  
•    to enable communications between users 
•    to send marketing and non-marketing communications to users
•    in connection with legal proceedings
We do not sell or share user personal data with third parties for their direct marketing, except with users’ consent.
We use the personal data we collect:
1. To provide our services. We use data to provide, personalize, maintain, and improve our services.
This includes using data to:
•    create/update accounts
•    enable transportation and delivery services (such as using location data to facilitate a pickup or delivery), features that involve data sharing (such as fare splitting, ETA sharing, and ratings and compliments), and accessibility features to facilitate the use of our services by those with disabilities
•    process payments
•    track and share the progress of services or deliveries
•    create travel itineraries and offer related services, such as services to the airport, rental car reservations, or food deliveries.

•    facilitate insurance, vehicle, invoicing, or financing solutions
•    perform necessary operations to maintain our services, including troubleshooting software bugs and operational problems; conducting data analysis, testing, and research; and monitoring and analyzing usage and activity trends.
We perform the above activities, including the collection and use of location data for purposes of these activities, because they are necessary to fulfill our obligations to users under our Terms of Use or other agreements with users.
2. Safety and security. We use personal data to help maintain the safety, security, and integrity of our services and users. This includes:
•    verifying users' identity and eligibility to provide transportation or deliveries, including through reviews of background checks, where permitted by law, to help prevent use of our services by unsafe Drivers/Service Providers and/or Customers.
In certain regions, this includes the Real-Time ID Check feature, which prompts Drivers/Service Providers and Delivery/Service persons to share a selfie before going online to help ensure that the driver or delivery person using the app matches the account we have on file. Where permitted by law, this also includes performing facial verification of photographs submitted by users, or collected from public databases, to prevent identity-borrowing or to verify users’ identities.
•    using device, location, user profile, usage, and other data to prevent, detect, and combat fraud. This includes identifying fraudulent accounts or uses of our services, preventing use of our services by unauthorized Drivers/Service Providers or Delivery/Service persons, verifying user identities in connection with certain payment methods, and preventing and combating unauthorized access to users’ accounts.
• Use user ratings, reported incidents, and other feedback to encourage compliance with our Community Guidelines and as grounds for deactivating users with low ratings or who otherwise violated such guidelines in certain countries.
•    sharing information regarding serious driver or delivery person safety incidents or compliance with local regulations with third parties, including other companies who enable users to request or provide rides or delivery services, or intermediaries who collect and report such information for multiple companies, to prevent Drivers/Service Providers or Delivery/Service persons who may pose a safety risk to the platform or its users from using Tranzit Technologies’s or those other companies’ services. We may also share with third parties, including those affected by such incidents, whether the incidents result in account deactivation.
•    using ratings, usage, and other data to prevent matching of Customers and Drivers/Service Providers for whom there is a higher risk of conflict (for instance, because one user previously gave the other a one-star rating).
We perform the above activities because they are necessary to fulfill our obligations to users under our Terms of Use or other agreements with users, and/or for purposes of the legitimate safety and security interests of other parties, including users and members of the general public.
3. Customer support. We use the information we collect (which may include call recordings) to provide customer support, including investigating and addressing user concerns and monitoring and improving our customer support responses and processes.
We perform the above activities because they are necessary to fulfill our obligations to users under our Terms of Use or other agreements with users.
4. Research and development. We may use personal data for testing, research, analysis, product development, and machine learning to improve the user experience. This helps us make our services more convenient and easy to use, enhance the safety and security of our services, and develop new services and features.
We perform the above activities because they are necessary to fulfill our obligations to users under our Terms of Use or other agreements with users in improving our existing services and features, or for purposes of legitimate interests in developing new services and features.
5. Enabling communications between users. For example, a driver may message or call a customer to confirm a pickup location, a customer may contact a driver/service provider to retrieve a lost item, or a vendor or delivery person may call a delivery recipient with information about their order.
We perform the above activities because they are necessary to fulfill our obligations to users under our Terms of Use or other agreements with users.
6. Marketing. We may use personal data to market our services to our users. This includes sending users communications about our services, features, promotions, sweepstakes, studies, surveys, news, updates, and events. We may do so through various methods, including email, text messages, push notifications, in-app communications and ads, and ads on third-party platforms.
We may also inform users about products and services offered by Our partners. For example, we may provide recommendations, promotions, or ads for our partners based on users’ past delivery orders. Although we inform users about products and services offered by Our partners, we do not sell users’ data to, or share it with, such partners or others for purposes of their direct marketing or advertising, except with users’ consent.
We may use the data we collect, including in combination with advertising partners’ data, to personalize and improve the marketing communications (including ads) that we send on and off the apps and websites, including based on user location, use of Our services, and user preferences and settings. For example, we share user data (such as hashed email addresses, usage information, and device or user identifiers) with Facebook and TikTok to personalize and improve our ads for Our services.
For information about how to opt out of certain marketing communications (including ads) from Us and its advertising partners, please see the section titled “Marketing choices.”
We may also send users communications regarding elections, ballots, referenda, and other political and notice processes that relate to our services. For example, We notified some users by email of ballot measures or pending legislation relating to Our services in those users’ areas.
We perform the above activities because they are necessary for purposes of legitimate interests in informing users about Our services and features or those offered by Our partners, or based on user consent. See the sections titled “Choice and transparency” and “Marketing choices” for information on your choices regarding Tranzit Technologies’s use of your data for marketing.
7. Non-marketing communications. We may use personal data to generate and provide users with receipts; inform them of changes to our terms, services, or policies; or send other communications that aren’t to market the services or products.
8. Legal proceedings and requirements. We may use personal data to investigate or address claims or disputes relating to the use of our services, to satisfy requirements under applicable laws, regulations, or operating licenses or agreements, or according to legal processes or governmental requests, including from law enforcement.
9. Automated decision-making
We use personal data to make automated decisions relating to the use of our services. This includes:
•    enabling dynamic pricing, in which the price of a service, or the delivery fee for Tranzit Technologies orders, is determined based on constantly varying factors such as the estimated time and distance, the predicted route, estimated traffic, and the number of Customers and Drivers/Service Providers using at a given moment.
•    matching available Drivers/Service Providers and Delivery/Service persons to users requesting services. Users can be matched based on availability, proximity, and other factors such as the likelihood of accepting a trip based on their past behavior or preferences. 
•    determining user ratings, and deactivating users with low ratings. In the European Union or where otherwise required by law, such deactivation occurs only after human review and/or the possibility of appeal. Please also see the section below titled “Ratings look-up” for further information.
•    flagging users who are identified as having engaged in fraud, unsafe activity, or other activities that may harm Tranzit Technologies, its users, and others. In some cases, such as when a user is determined to be abusing Tranzit Technologies’s referral program or has submitted fraudulent documents, such behavior may result in automatic deactivation, or the European Union or where otherwise required by law, deactivation after human review.
•    using driver location information, and communications between Customers and Drivers/Service Providers, to identify cancellation fees earned or induced through fraud. For example, if we determine by using such information that a driver is delaying a delivery pickup to induce a cancellation, we will not charge the customer a cancellation fee and will adjust the amounts paid to the driver/service provider to omit such a fee. To object to such an adjustment, please contact Our customer support.
•    Using driver/service provider data (such as location, rating, and gender) and customer data (such as rating, origin, and destination) to help avoid pairings of users that may result in increased risk of conflict.
To object to a deactivation resulting from these processes, please contact Our customer support.
We perform the above activities because they are necessary to fulfill our obligations to users under our Terms of Use or other agreements with users, or because they are necessary for purposes of the legitimate interests of Us, its users, and others.

8. With consent
We may share a user’s data other than as described in this notice if we notify the user and they consent to the sharing.
E. Data retention and deletion
We retain user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above.
We retain user data to provide its services and comply with its legal obligations. 
We retain user data for as long as necessary for the purposes described above. The period for which we retain user data is determined by the type of data, the category of user to whom the data relates, and the purposes for which we collect the data.
The length for which We retain user data may further be determined by legal and regulatory requirements, purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or by issues relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute.
For example:
We retain user data of riders and order recipients that is processed to provide our services, such as the user profile information and credentials, for the lifetime of the user's account.
We retain certain categories of users for a maximum of 7 years regardless of the lifetime of the user's account, such as location data used to calculate the fee of the trip to comply with Tax regulations.
We retain certain categories of data of all users for a period unrelated to the lifetime of the user's account, to avoid fraudulent use of the app. The period for which the data is retained will be determined by the necessity of the data for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, as well as legal and regulatory requirements. Examples include incomplete driver applications, which are retained for 1 year, and rejected driver applications and customer service communications on safety incidents, which are retained for 7 years.
Under legal and regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute, we may retain certain categories of data after the deletion of the user's account, such as user profile information, vehicle and tax data. This generally means that we retain their account and data for 7 years after a deletion request.
Users may request deletion of their accounts at any time. We may retain user data after a deletion request due to legal or regulatory requirements or for reasons stated in this policy.

Users may request deletion of their account at any time through the Settings > Privacy menus in the Our app, or Our’s website (riders and order recipients here; drivers and delivery persons here; guest checkout users here).
Following an account deletion request, We delete the user’s account and data, unless they must be retained due to legal or regulatory requirements, for purposes of safety, security, and fraud prevention, or because of an issue relating to the user’s account such as an outstanding credit or an unresolved claim or dispute. Because we are subject to legal and regulatory requirements relating to drivers and delivery persons, this generally means that we retain their account and data for the applicable statutory retention period after a deletion request. For riders and order recipients, their data is generally deleted within 90 days of a deletion request, except where retention is necessary for the above reasons.
IV. Choice and transparency
We enable users to access and/or control data that We collect, including through: 
privacy settings
device permissions
in-app rating pages
marketing choices 
We also enable users to request access to or copies of their data, make changes or updates to their accounts, request deletion of their accounts, or request that We restrict its processing of user data.
A. Privacy settings
The Settings > Privacy menu in the app allows riders and order recipients to set or update their preferences regarding location data collection and sharing, emergency data sharing, and notifications. Our Privacy Center is also available in the web version.
Location data collection 
User can enable/disable the app to share their real-time location data from their mobile devices with their drivers through their device settings, which can be accessed via the Settings > My Profile > Address. 
Emergency Data Sharing
We collect location data to track the location of drivers and show order status on the customer app so the customer easily track his order status through the app. When the app is closed or not in use, data is not trackable.
In the Agent app, we are tracking the location of the agent in the background mode as well while they are working for us, as soon as they mark their off Duty and clear the application from the background, we do not take the location or track the agent.
Users may enable the app to send push notifications about discounts and news from the App. Push notifications may be enabled or disabled through the Backend panel.
Communications from restaurants and merchants
While placing an order in the app, users may opt-in to share their contact details with certain restaurants or merchants to receive communications from them. 
B. Device permissions
Most mobile device platforms (iOS, Android, etc.) have defined certain types of device data that apps cannot access without the device owner’s permission, and these platforms have different methods for how that permission can be obtained. Please check the available settings on your device or check with your provider.
C. In-app rating pages
After every trip, drivers and riders can rate each other on a scale from 1 to 5. An average of those ratings is associated with a user’s account and is displayed to other users for whom they provide or receive services. For example, rider ratings are available to drivers from whom they request transportation, and driver ratings are available to their riders.
This 2-way system holds everyone accountable for their behavior. Accountability helps create a respectful, safe environment for drivers and riders.
Riders can see their average rating in the main menu of the app, and also access a breakdown of their average rating in Our’s Privacy Center.
Drivers can see their average rating after tapping their profile photo in our Driver app. Click here for more information.
Delivery persons may also be rated by order recipients, restaurants, and merchants. Click here for more information.
Cookies and related technologies: For information on how to control the use of cookies and related technologies, including for purposes of displaying personalized ads, please see our Cookie Notice.
